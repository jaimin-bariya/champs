# MyToDo App 📝

## Overview

MyToDo is a real-time multi-user collaboration todo list application built using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to collaboratively manage tasks with features such as live updates, task assignments, and role-based access control.

## Key Features 🔑

### User Authentication and Access Control

- **Secure Registration and Login**: Users can securely register and log in to the application.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different roles define permissions (e.g., create, edit, delete tasks).

### Real-Time Task Updates

- **Live Collaboration**: Users see real-time updates when tasks are created, edited, or completed.
- **Presence Indicators**: Display online/offline status and active users editing tasks.

### Task Management 📅

- **Create and Edit Tasks**: Users can create new tasks, set due dates, assignees, priorities, and descriptions.
- **Task Comments**: Allow users to comment on tasks for discussions or updates.
- **Task Assignments**: Assign tasks to specific users and notify them of new assignments.

### Collaboration Features 🤝

- **Real-Time Editing**: Enable simultaneous editing of tasks by multiple users with instant updates.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement mechanisms to handle concurrent edits and prevent data loss (e.g., last writer wins, merge changes).

### Search and Filters 🔍

- **Advanced Search**: Users can search tasks by title, assignee, due date, etc.
- **Filters**: Options to filter tasks by status (e.g., incomplete, completed), priority, or assignee.
